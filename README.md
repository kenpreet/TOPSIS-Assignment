# TOPSIS Assignment

## Methodology
TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a 
multi-criteria decision-making method used to rank alternatives based on 
their distance from the ideal best and ideal worst solutions.

Steps involved:
1. Normalize the decision matrix
2. Apply weights to criteria
3. Determine ideal best and ideal worst values
4. Calculate distance from ideal solutions
5. Compute TOPSIS score and rank alternatives

## Result Table
The result table contains:
- Topsis Score
- Rank of each alternative

Higher TOPSIS score indicates a better alternative.

---

## Result Graph
A bar graph is plotted to visually compare the TOPSIS scores of all alternatives.

The graph helps in easy interpretation of the ranking results.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
